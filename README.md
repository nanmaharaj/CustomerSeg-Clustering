# Customer Segmentation for Targeted Promotions

This project focuses on identifying distinct customer segments through a series of analytical steps to enhance promotional strategies and improve marketing efforts.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - **Load the Dataset**: Import the dataset into the environment.
   - **Initial Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and potential anomalies.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Identify and address missing data through removal.
   - **Remove Outliers**: Detect and eliminate outliers that could skew analysis results.
   - **Correct Data Types**: Ensure that all data types are appropriate for analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - **Create New Features**: Develop new features based on domain knowledge to enhance model performance.
   - **Encode Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical form.
     
4. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Scale and Normalize Features**: Standardize features to ensure uniformity across the dataset.

5. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - **Apply Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**: Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features while retaining significant information.

6. **Optimal Number of Clusters Determination**
   - **Elbow Method or Silhouette Analysis**: Apply to determine the optimal number of clusters.

7. **Cluster Analysis**
   - **Cluster the Data**: Perform clustering using K-Means based on the results from the Elbow Method or Silhouette Analysis and assign cluster labels to each data point.

8. **Cluster Demographic Evaluation**
   - **Analyze Cluster Demographics**: Evaluate and interpret the demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, income) of each cluster.

9. **Cluster Shopping Habits Evaluation**
   - **Analyze Shopping Habits by Cluster**: Examine the shopping behaviors (e.g., purchase frequency, product categories) within each cluster to draw insights about customer segments.
